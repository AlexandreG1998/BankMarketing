# BankMarketing
This is a Neural Network's application in a public UCI problem
Dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

# Strategy

Create a training dataset with 50% of each class (as the 'yes' class are too small in comparison the 'no' class) so a model apply in a pure would have a false accuracy.
Run a Neural Network powered by Tensorflow with Keras with Interface.
Run the rest of data to test the model.
